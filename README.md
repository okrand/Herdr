# Herdr
App Development for Smart Devices course project. An app that connects people and helps them get together for any activity ASAP.

The purpose of this app is to bring people together. Using various technologies on top of native Android such as Google Firebase, Google Maps API, and Facebook API, Herdr connects people for group activities immediately.

Meetup is great for meeting like minded people but it takes days, sometimes weeks to actually meet the people. Think of Herdr as Meetup meets Tinder. You get together with people for activities, but you get together the day of.

Let's say it's Saturday and you feel like playing tennis. None of your local friends is into tennis so you have to find someone to play with. You go on Herdr and search for a herd about tennis. If it doesn't exist, you create your own herd. 

You select the time and place and people join as they find out about you. In 2 hours, you have found 5 people to play tennis with. You all go to a court and enjoy your Saturday.
